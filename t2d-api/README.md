# t2d-api

This is wrapper around a unison codebase hosted on Unison share (TODO: add link here).

## Dev

Install unison following the instructions on the unison-lang website

Run UCM and pull the codebase from unison share into a local namespace.

Follow the unison-lang docs on how to create a pull request.

(These are all vague, I need to make these more detailed soon)

## Deployment

Commit a change with an update to `CHANGELOG.md`. A github action will notice the difference and trigger a deploy.
